# Program-Element_Quiz
This program requires the use of print output and use of input, for/in loop, if, file open, .readline, .append, .strip, len. and function def and return. The code should also consider using most of the following (.upper() or .lower(), .title(), print("hello",end="") else, elif, range(), while, .close())


Program: Element_Quiz
In this program the user enters the name of any 5 of the first 20 Atomic Elements and is given a grade and test report for items correct and incorrect.

Sample input and output:
list any 5 of the first 20 elements in the Period table
Enter the name of an element: argon
Enter the name of an element: chlorine
Enter the name of an element: sodium
Enter the name of an element: argon
argon was already entered          <--no duplicates allowed
Enter the name of an element: helium
Enter the name of an element: gold

80 % correct
Found: Argon Chlorine Sodium Helium 
Not Found: Gold 
Create get_names() Function to collect input of 5 unique element names
The function accepts no arguments and returns a list of 5 input strings (element names)
define a list to hold the input
collect input of a element name
if input it is not already in the list add the input to the list
don't allow empty strings as input
once 5 unique inputs return the list
Create the Program flow
import the file into the Jupyter Notebook environment
use !curl to download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/intropython/master/elements1_20.txt as elements1_20.txt
open the file with the first 20 elements
read one line at a time to get element names, remove any whitespace (spaces, newlines) and save each element name, as lowercase, into a list
Call the get_names() function
the return value will be the quiz responses list
check if responses are in the list of elements
Iterate through 5 responses

compare each response to the list of 20 elements
any response that is in the list of 20 elements is correct and should be added to a list of correct responses
if not in the list of 20 elements then add to a list of incorrect responses
calculate the % correct
find the the number of items in the correct responses and divide by 5, this will result in answers like 1.0, .8, .6,...
to get the % multiple the calculated answer above by 100, this will result in answers like 100, 80, 60...
hint: instead of dividing by 5 and then multiplying by 100, the number of correct responses can be multiplied by 20
Print output
print the Score % right
print each of the correct responses
print each of the incorrect responses
